# simple-node-js-react-npm-app

This repository is for the
[Build a Node.js and React app with npm](https://jenkins.io/doc/tutorials/build-a-node-js-and-react-app-with-npm/)
tutorial in the [Jenkins User Documentation](https://jenkins.io/doc/).

The repository contains a simple Node.js and React application which generates
a web page with the content "Welcome to React" and is accompanied by a test to
check that the application renders satisfactorily.

The `jenkins` directory contains an example of the `Jenkinsfile` (i.e. Pipeline)
you'll be creating yourself during the tutorial and the `scripts` subdirectory
contains shell scripts with commands that are executed when Jenkins processes
the "Test" and "Deliver" stages of your Pipeline.

Make sure Jenkins, Docker and Kubernets are installed.
Install Node Js packages.

Inorder to run the application execute the command:  npm start --port 3004
this command will run the react application on 3004 and once the user clicks on the button Jenkins will start running on 3000 port.
